                        <p>
                            When looking for a job you have to keep in mind that there is no specific job approach that works for every
                            applicant!
                            You have to develop your own strategy and this takes time. In other words, start planning your job search
                            strategically!

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Besides using your personal networks, newspapers, notice boards at the employment service centers and the Kora
                            job
                            portal, there are many companies’ websites where you can find job offers.

                        <h3> How to write a CV?</h3>
                        <p>
                            A CV (curriculum vitae) allows you to summarise your education, skills and experience and helps you market yourself to
                            employers. Typically, CVs are at least two or three pages.
                            When writing a CV, there are a few helpful rules you should follow;
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Match your CV to the position. Make sure that you highlight your education, work experience, and skills to relate to the
                                        particular industry or job. For example, if you are applying for a job in education, you might want to put your teaching
                                        experience at the top of your CV.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>You can also include keywords from the job description in your CV. This will show the employer that you are an ideal fit
                                        for the position.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Use a template. You may want to use a template to structure your CV. This will give your application a clear structure,
                                        which will help the employer quickly see your qualifications and experience.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>You need to thoroughly edit your document to make sure there are no spelling or grammatical errors and that the format
                                        is uniform – for example, if you use bullet points in one job description, use the same bullet points in all the
                                        remaining job descriptions..</p>
                                </li>

                        <p>
                            A cover letter is a letter sent alongside your CV and other attachments to introduce yourself and explain why you are
                            sending in the application. It also provides more information about yourself.
                            <br>

                            If you are registered at KORA you can save a cover letter example, but don’t forget you always have to re-write it and
                            adapt it to every vacancy! Never use the same letter twice!

                        <h3>Preparing for interviews</h3>
                        <p>
                            If you are invited for a job interview: Congratulations! You already made it very far! Now you must prove that you are
                            the most suitable candidate for the position.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I have some tips for you:<br>
                            A job interview is a meeting with an objective. It is the employer’s objective to find the best person for the job.
                            Therefore, an employer will want to review the candidate’s experience and abilities. In this meeting, the employer will
                            try to find out:
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Can you do the job? (skills, abilities, qualifications)</li>
                                <li>Will you do the job? (interest, attitude & motivation)</li>
                                <li>How will you fit into the organisation? (personality)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            As the job applicant, you might also have the objective to find out:
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>What does this position offer me?</li>
                                <li>How does it fit with my career plans?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            Never go unprepared for a job interview! Preparation is key to success:
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Review your own skills, experiences and qualities</li>
                                <li>Check your CV again</li>
                                <li>Anticipate questions and identify relevant examples</li>
                                <li>Prepare key selling points (self-marketing)</li>
                                <li>Research about the organisation or company</li>
                                <li>Check their websites, reports, articles, company literature etc.</li>
                                <li>Contacts with knowledge of organisation or sector can help</li>
                                <li>Read relevant articles in the press</li>
                                <li>Think about a personal visit or telephone call before the interview</li>
                                <li>Research job and occupational area</li>
                                <li>Job description – or similar</li>
                                <li>Current issues</li>
                                <li>What are salary standards for such positions or similar ones?</li>
                                <li>Prepare your questions</li>
                                <li>Practice, Practice, Practice!! You can ask your nearest employment service centre for help, or practice with family and
                                    friends.</li>

                        <p>
                            You should keep record of the positions that you apply for and dates when you applied. These records will help you stay
                            organized and create a history of your searches that can be helpful. After some time, you may need to improve your
                            application documents or rethink your job search strategy or maybe need more training or take a new short course or
                            volunteer work or internship to gain more experience.

                            Sometimes it can help to gain more working experience before applying for jobs. You could consider interning or
                            volunteering! This would help you to gain practical knowledge in technical terms but also make you more familiar with
                            working environments. Furthermore, you get to be surrounded by people who have jobs and have a chance to increase your
                            personal networks
