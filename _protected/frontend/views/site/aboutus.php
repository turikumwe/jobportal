                The Government of Rwanda designed policies and employed a considerable effort to combat 
                the issue of unemployment  by establishing Public Employment Service Centres, which have a 
                mandate of addressing unemployment and underemployment by linking jobseekers and job 
                providers.<br><br>
                The centres also provide information for decision making in career planning, information 
                and training on job search strategy and other counselling support that could result into 
                job placement.<br><br>
                The first Public Employment Service Centres are established with the City of Kigali, 
                Musanze District and Huye Distict.<br><br>
                In order to reach out to more employers and jobseekers, RDB created this portal to offer 
                a variety of employment services online. <br><br>
                Employers will find here useful information about the Rwandan labour market, guidelines 
                and practical tips regarding recruitment process and relevant labour law information. 
                Besides having the opportunity to post job offers, employers who are registered on the 
                portal have access to profiles of jobseekers and can find the right candidates in a 
                cost-effective way. Even if you are a private business looking for a plumber, you can 
                find a worker instantly through the portal.<br><br>
                In order to improve on the quality of job applications the portal offers online career 
                guidance and planning tools as well as CV and cover letter templates.<br><br>
                It reveals guidelines on how to prepare for interviews and check job readiness.<br><br>
                In addition to our online services, the Public Employment Service Centres are there to 
                support you according to your needs. Please get in touch!
